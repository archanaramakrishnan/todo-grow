TODO: Grow is a planner and productivity app. It serves as a reminder to the user of tasks they need to work through a to-do list view. Its unique selling point is that it shows a visual description of your progress! Users will see a tree that slowly grows based on how much work you finish. This motivates the user to keep going and primes them to protect and grow their tree friend and protect their progress from distractions. This positive reinforcement will serve as a healthy way to achieve your goals. Most importantly, there is also a to-do list for self care in pink. If the user creates and finishes self care tasks for themselves, the tree blooms with pretty pink flowers. The target audience is anyone who wants to be determined to work hard and make progress. It could especially appeal to young adults who would like to share their tree on social media with friends.


The tree that is rendered on the screen follows a recursive algorithm. This gives it a symmetrical and ordered look with some degree of randomness in terms of branch length and leaf/petal colors to make it look natural. The to do list has features to add, delete and check off items. Additionally, they can be filtered based on which tasks have been completed, which are active and a default option to see all items. The app shows today's date and a small prompt at the bottom to push the user to get started on building their tree. The app has elements of React accessibility embedded in it, hoping to reach users of all kinds.
